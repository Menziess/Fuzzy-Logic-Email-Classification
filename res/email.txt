Dear Mr. Lee,

I write on behalf of my CEO, Ms. Douglas, of the Dutch cell phone company ‘‘cell.com’’.
You’ve met Ms. Douglas at the Cebit Trade Fair in Hannover. She was highly satisfied with your inspirational inventions, especially the auto rechargeable cell phone. This new technique is not only eco friendly, but also very efficient in many ways. This is why our company has a positive vision of our potential collaboration.

Considering the fact that our eye went to your invention, we would like to set up a deal. 
Ms. Douglas wants to draw up an order of 3.000 head of your cell phones. But instead of €130,- a piece, a descent settlement would be more appropriate seen the extent of the purchase.

First we would like to receive a small amount of your cell phones. This to confirm our decision and test the Dutch view on your product. Then we would like to discuss the business aspect of this matter, which we also prefer on black and white. However, we most certainly are beyond doubt of the success. 

Nevertheless, we look forward to our rewarding cooperation.

Yours sincerely.

Lara Porter, 
Manager cell.com
